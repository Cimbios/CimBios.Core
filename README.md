## Description

CimBios.Core is a cross-platform .NET library providing a comprehensive API for handling the Common Information Model (CIM).

* **CIM RDF Serialization and Deserialization:**  Effortlessly convert CIM data between its native format and RDF (Resource Description Framework).
* **Model Data Validation:** Ensure data integrity with built-in validation against CIM schemas.
* **Extensible RDF Schema Meta Model:**  Easily adapt to evolving CIM standards and custom extensions.
* **Difference Model Support:** Efficiently compare and identify changes between different CIM models.
